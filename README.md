# Nexus Wakfu Companion

**Live Tool:** [https://wakfu-companion-production.up.railway.app/](https://wakfu-companion-production.up.railway.app/)

**Nexus Wakfu Companion** is a high-performance, browser-based utility for _Wakfu_ players. It parses the game's `wakfu-chat.log` file in real-time using the **File System Access API**, providing an interactive overlay for combat statistics, inventory tracking, and multilingual chat translation without requiring any local installation or game client modification.

## 🚀 New in This Version

- **📉 Memory Optimization:** Implemented batch rendering and DOM limiting to prevent memory leaks during long sessions or massive loot streaks (reduced memory usage to <200MB).
- **🔍 Item Tracker Filters:** Filter your tracking list by Gathering Profession (Miner, Farmer, Trapper, etc.) or view All items with a single click.
- **⚡ Smart Sorting:** Tracker sorting now prioritizes Crafting Professions first, then Item Level, then Name. Supports Ascending/Descending toggle.
- **🛠️ Profession XP Calculator:** Renamed and improved. Calculate resources needed for specific level ranges and add them directly to your tracker.
